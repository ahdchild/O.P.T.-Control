* **Tripwire Trigger** - Distance trigger can configured to work like a tripwire
* **Sound Trigger** - Trigger shutter or flash with loud sounds
* **Lightning Photography** - Using a light sensor. This one is very experimental until some testing can be completed
* **Intervalometer**
* **Room light** - For shots that require dark settings, O.P.T. control has a high power LED to illuminate the work area that will automatically trun off during the shot.
